# Static-Micromaps-geographical-
Micromaps are a great way to visualize geographic data! They typically involve breaking down a larger geographic area into smaller regions and using small visual elements to represent data for each region.
To create a static micromap, We can follow these steps:
<p>1) Create a simple dataset for population in six countries and then generate a static micromap using Python with the help of the geopandas library. Before running this code, make sure you have geopandas and matplotlib installed.</p>
<p>2) Convert the dataset to a GeoDataFrame with a world map</p>
<p>3) Plot the static micromap</p>
<p>4) Add labels and title</p>
